# energy-data-connected-devices-python

I analyse and detect connected devices on a single submeter.
Data from a sample week in november selected to see the pattern
of heating driven consumption.
This analysis can be completed by selectig a sample week in summer.
So, cooling driven energy consumption (air conditioner) can be detected too.
